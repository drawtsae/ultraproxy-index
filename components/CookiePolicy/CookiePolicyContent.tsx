        <strong>1. What Are Cookies?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Cookies are small text files placed on your device (computer,
        smartphone, tablet) by websites you visit. They are widely used to make
        websites function properly, improve the user experience, remember
        preferences, and provide information to the site owners. Other similar
        technologies (such as pixels, web beacons, and device fingerprinting)
        may also be used for similar purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2. Types of Cookies We Use</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We use both first-party and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are
        set by us and help enable core functionalities, whereas third-party
        cookies are set by service providers and partners to provide additional
        features.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>a. Strictly Necessary Cookies</strong>:<br />
        These cookies are essential for the proper operation of our Services.
        They enable core features such as security measures, session management,
        and network traffic distribution. Without these cookies, the Services
        may not function properly.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Examples: Cookies that store your session ID, authentication tokens,
            or load balancing identifiers.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>b. Functional Cookies</strong>:<br />
        These cookies allow the Services to remember choices you make (such as
        language preference or region) and provide enhanced, more personalized
        features. Disabling these cookies may result in a less personalized
        experience.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Examples: Cookies that remember your language settings or interface

        <strong>c. Performance and Analytics Cookies</strong>:<br />
        We use these cookies to understand how users interact with the Services.
        They help us track and measure performance, detect and fix errors, and
        improve the overall user experience. The information collected by these
        cookies is typically aggregated and does not directly identify you as an
        individual.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Examples: Cookies from analytics services that measure page load
            times, usage patterns, and error rates.

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>d. Targeting and Advertising Cookies</strong>:<br />
        We may use these cookies to deliver relevant advertisements about our
        Services or to measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
        These cookies track browsing habits and activity across our Services and
        may combine this information with data collected on other websites or
        apps. Disabling these cookies will not reduce the number of ads you see,
        but may make them less relevant to you.

      <p>
        <strong>5. Cookie Duration</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Cookies can be session-based or persistent:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Session Cookies</strong>: These cookies exist only for the
            duration of your browsing session and expire when you close your
            browser or log out of your account.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Persistent Cookies</strong>: These remain on your device
            after you have closed your browser or ended your session. They are
            used to remember your preferences and identify you during subsequent
            visits.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The retention period for persistent cookies varies depending on their
        function and the third party that sets them. We regularly review and
        update our use of cookies and their expiration periods.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6. Managing Your Cookie Preferences</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You have several options to manage and control how cookies are used on
        your device:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Browser Settings</strong>: Most web browsers allow you to
            block, disable, or delete cookies. Instructions for managing cookie
            settings can be found in your browser’s help documentation.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Do Not Track (DNT)</strong>: Some browsers include a DNT
            setting. While we strive to respect your privacy, we do not
            currently respond to DNT signals because no industry standard has
            been established.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>

            targeted advertising cookies by using industry-supported opt-out
            tools provided by organizations like the Network Advertising
            Initiative (NAI) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), where
            applicable.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Consent Management</strong>: If available, you can use our
            on-site cookie consent banner or preference center to manage which
            categories of cookies you wish to accept or reject.
